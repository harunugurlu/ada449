#### Before getting started you should write your student_number in integer format
const student_number::Int64 = 28532046358  ## <---replace 0 by your student_number

## Assume that you are given a matrix A. In this assignment you will need to find inverse of A provided that it is invertibble, 
## you want to determine B so that AB is close to I_d as much as possible use LinearAlgebra.norm!!!!.
## and solve this problem as an unconstrained optimization problem.
## We will now do this step by step. 
## Given A, pick B similar to A (has the same shape)
## 1) Implement your objective function (if you use norm, make sure you take its square not itself!)
## 2) Fix your learning rate, and max_iter
## 3) Do gradient descent until some convergence stopping_criterions are met!!!
## 3.5) If your matrix is not invertible your function should throw an error!!!
### 4) Remember that matrix A should be square and has non-zero determinant in order to be invertible. 

function objective(A::AbstractMatrix, b::AbstractMatrix)::AbstractFloat
    ## Your code here!!!
    if size(A, 1) != size(A, 2) || det(A) == 0
        throw(ArgumentError("Matrix A must be square with a non-zero determinant."))
    end
    AB_diff = A * b - Matrix(I, size(A))
    return norm(AB_diff)^2
end



### Some unit test as usual!!!!
function unit_test_objective()::Bool
    for _ in 1:100
        let 
            A = randn(100, 100)
            objective(A, A^-1)
            @assert isapprox(objective(A,A^(-1)),0; atol = 1e-3) "Something went wrong!!!"
        end
    end
    @info "Oki Doki!!!"
    return 1
end

## Let's give a try to objective function!!!!
unit_test_objective()


function fit_(A::AbstractMatrix;
    lr::Float64 = 0.001, 
    max_iter::Int64 = 1000,
    stopping_criterion::Float64 = 1e-2)
     ## Your code here ##
     # A shoul be invertible and square. We are checking it here.
    if size(A, 1) != size(A, 2) || det(A) == 0
        throw(ArgumentError("Matrix A must be square with a non-zero determinant."))
    end

    B = randn(size(A)...)
    for i in 1:max_iter

        grad_B = Zygote.gradient(B -> objective(A, B), B)[1]

        B -= lr * grad_B
        # convergence check here...
        if norm(grad_B) < stopping_criterion
            break
        end
    end
    return B
end

## Let's give a try to see what happens!!!
a = randn(10,10)
q = fit_(a, max_iter = 10000, lr = 0.01, stopping_criterion = 1e-4)
##Is the following matrix close to identity matrix?
q*a 
## 

function unit_test_fit()
    Random.seed!(0)
    A = randn(3,3)
    try
        @assert isapprox(A\I(3), fit_(A, max_iter = 20000, lr = 0.001), atol = 1e-1)
    catch AssertionError
        @info "You gotto do it again Pal!!, adjust the learning rate and watch the convergence!!!"
        throw("Something went wrong!!!!")
    end
    @info "Great Success!!! Grab a cup of coffeeeeee!!!!"
    return 1
end



## Run the next function to see you are doing good!!!
unit_test_fit()
##Great!!!!

## No need to run below!!!
if abspath(PROGRAM_FILE) == @__FILE__
    G::Int64 = unit_test_objective()+unit_test_fit()
    dict_ = Dict("std_ID"=>student_number, "G"=>G)
    try
        BSON.@save "$(student_number).res" dict_ 
        catch Exception 
            println("something went wrong with", Exception)
    end
